# Girls' Night In Movie App
The Girls' Night In movie app is a fun way to find, save and share movies all in one place!

Forgot the movie your momâ€™s friendâ€™s sister suggested last Thursday but you remember part of the name? Well now you can search by a full (or partial title) and films associated with your entry will populate. 

Want to share a new found movie with your friends? We got you covered with a custom QR Code!

Secured by Firebase authentication, the Girls' Night In movie app uses a Node and Express Web Server backed by a MongoDB database and Mongoose ODM structured within an MVC Paradigm. With `GET, POST and DELETE` routes, the user can retrieve, add and delete movie data. 

Girls' Night In generates unique QR codes for each movie using `QRCode.React NPM` allowing the user to view more information about a movie on the IMDB website and easily share favorite movies with friends. 

For a personalized experience, the user is required to sign up for access to the Girls' Night In movie app. `Firebase` authentication is used to save user login information, user-specific saved movies and determine user login status.

## About The Project

#### Netflix has a cumbersome UI for searching for movie titles from your TV remote. The Girls' Night In app is a fun alternative to searching movie titles on your TV remote. Additionally, you can view in-depth movie information and share movie titles with friends via a QR code!
<br>

When the app launches, the user sees a `Login` page where they can sign into their movie profile or create a new profile by clicking `Sign up Here!`.

* When the user logs into the app, they are taken to the main `Search For A Movie` page where they can search for a movie and view their saved favorite movies. On this main page the user can:
    * Search for movies by title or partial title,
    * View all saved favorite movies,
    * Select a movie poster for more information on a specific movie, or 
    * Have an option to view the movie `QR Code`, `Favorite` or `Delete` a movie,
    * Sign out of the app

* When a user clicks on a movie poster on the main page, they are taken to a popup page with options available for actions specific to the selected movie. The user can:
    * View more information about the movie including:
        * Title, 
        * Release year,
        * IMDB rating,
        * Plot 
    * The user can then:    
        * Scan the QR code to open the associated movie page on IMBD,
        * Favorite the selected movie (saving to their user profile),
        * Delete the selected movie (removing the movie from their user profile),
        * Close the popup page which takes the user back to the search page where their saved favorites are rendered.
